## Birthday Invitation
Mad Lib is a project that takes in user input and uses that input to produce a custom birthday invitation.

In the creation of this project, we introduce the following concepts:
- working in the `main()` method
- saving text into variables
- printing output to the console
- using the `Scanner` class
